# 🌌 NEURAL_OS // GENESIS
**The Ultra-Futuristic Multimodal AI Interface**

NEURAL_OS is a high-fidelity, spatial UI chatbot platform inspired by the clean, fluid aesthetic of Google Gemini. It features a sophisticated "Aura" background engine, multimodal image processing, and a professional-grade command center layout.
